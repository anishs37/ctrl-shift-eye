This project would not be possible without all the datasets and resources we obtained from online.

Segmentation Dataset: The dataset used to train our segmentation model can be found [here](https://www.mut1ny.com/10-segmentation-data/12-face-headsegmentation-labeling-tool).
MPIIGaze Dataset: The dataset used to train our gaze tracking model can be found [here](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-machine-learning/research/gaze-based-human-computer-interaction/appearance-based-gaze-estimation-in-the-wild).
Segmentation Model: The segmentation model was first developed by Olaf Ronneberger et al, and a paper discussing the model can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597).
Gaze Tracking Model: The few lines of code used to call MobileNet can be attributed to the Google Cloud Platform, and that code can be found [here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst/blob/master/courses/fast-and-lean-data-science/07_Keras_Flowers_TPU_xception_fine_tuned_best.ipynb).
